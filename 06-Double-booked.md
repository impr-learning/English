### Tom
Arrgh!

### Narrator
Anna, this is the moment to show you’re willing to help.

### Anna
Yes!

### Narrator
Use phrases like 'Is there anything I can do?' 'Let me help!' or, to be more informal, you can say, 'Can I give you a hand?' or 'Give me a shout if you need anything!'

### Anna
Right.

### Narrator
Go on!

### Anna
Are you okay Tom?

### Tom
(`grumpily`) No.
> grumpily 性情乖戾地;脾气粗暴地

### Anna
Is there anything I can do?

### Tom
(grumpily) No.

### Anna
Oh. What's wrong?

### Tom
Everything.

### Anna
I see. Can I give you a hand?

### Tom
My computer has crashed. I've lost my phone. And there's a big, big problem with my timetable. I’ve got two meetings scheduled at the same
time with two extremely important clients. I can't do them both at once!

### Anna
Let me help.

### Tom
Thanks Anna, but these are big, big clients. They need someone of experience.

### Anna
Well, `give me a shout` if you need anything!
> give me a shout 喊我一声

### Tom
I can handle this, alright?

### Narrator
'I can handle this'... ungrateful idiot. But you used all the right phrases Anna, well done. Anyway, I bet he'll change his mind.

### Denise
Oooh, I know, and the purple ones are so much more powerful...

### Tom
Anna? Could you help me?

### Narrator
Ha! I told you so!

### Tom
They've both arrived at once! Oh god! I'll `deal with` Mrs Kumquat...
> deal with 处理；与…打交道; 和…有生意往来

### Anna
Okay.

### Tom
You talk to Mr Lime, he's from a company called Citrus Ventures. They own hundreds of juice bars.

### Denise
Are you sure that's a good idea Tom?

### Tom
I don't have much choice, do I?

### Denise
Well I could

### Tom
Just keep him occupied Anna, tell him how great he is... no, no, tell him how great I am. Find out what he wants. If it's about the - well, never
mind, just be nice. 

### Anna
Understood.

### Tom
Mr Lime! Are you well?

### Mr Lime
Yes, but I'm actually rather angry too.

### Tom
Ah, well let me introduce you to Anna!

### Anna
Mr Lime, it's a pleasure to meet you! Let me `help with your coat`.
> coat 外套

> help with your coat 帮你拿外套

### Mr Lime
Oh er... Thank you.

### Anna
Can I give you a hand with your scarf too, Mr Lime?

### Mr Lime
Oh... Thanks.

### Anna
Now, please come this way and you can tell me what's wrong.

### Narrator
Well done! Anna used some good phrases to step in and help with this mess. Let's hear them again:

Is there anything I can do?

Let me help.

Can I give you a hand?

Give me a shout if you need anything.
