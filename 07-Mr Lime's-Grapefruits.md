### Anna
Well Mr Lime, how can I help you?

### Mr Lime
On Monday I was meant to receive 8,000 plastic grapefruit from Tip Top Trading.

### Anna
Yes.

### Mr Lime
The delivery was made on Tuesday.

### Anna
Oh dear.

### Mr Lime
And instead of 8,000 plastic grapefruit, I got 800,000 plastic pineapples!

### Narrator
Right Anna, this is serious. You're going to have to apologise and show that you really mean it. Say: I'm really sorry to hear that.

### Anna
I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.

### Mr Lime
What `on earth` am I going to do with 800,000 plastic pineapples?

### Narrator
Show Mr Lime that you understand the problem. These are phrases you can use: That's totally unacceptable. That must have been very inconvenient for you. And then promise to fix the problem.

### Mr Lime
800,000 plastic pineapples!

### Anna
That's totally unacceptable.

### Mr Lime
I didn't even have anywhere to put them - and pineapples are so much bigger than grapefruit!

### Anna
It must have been very inconvenient for you.

### Mr Lime
It certainly was! When he took my order, your colleague Tom told me that Tip Top Trading was the most reliable firm in the industry!

### Anna
You `have my word` that we will sort this out. We'll remove the pineapples and have your grapefruit sent via express delivery this afternoon.

### Mr Lime
Good. Thank you.

### Anna
And we could include some of our `latest-edition` imitation oranges to make up for the inconvenience.

### Mr Lime
Oh! Well, that would be nice!

Tip top Anna! Excellent work and excellent words.

They're made with `revolutionary` premium `faux-orange`, `laser-curve` definition technology... you will be the first to have them!

Wow, now that's good customer service! Tell me, do you have any other `artificial` fruits in this range?
> artificial 人造的

### Anna
Yes. Well, it's a bit of a secret, but you're a trusted client, so I think I can tell you...

### Mr Lime
Go on...

### Anna
We're about to `unveil` a new `Imperial Lemon`.

### Mr Lime
Really?

### Anna
I can't tell you any more for now. But…

### Mr Lime
Yes...

### Anna
Maybe we could present it to you more formally in a couple of weeks, when it's ready for release...?

### Mr Lime
Sounds perfect.

### Anna
You would be the first to see it!

### Mr Lime
Excellent. Thank you, er... Anna, isn't it?

### Anna
Yes.

### Mr Lime
A very pretty name.

### Anna
Thanks. It's spelled the same forwards and backwards. 

### Mr Lime
Is it really?

### Anna
Anyway, Mr Lime, we'll fix this grapefruit problem for you, and I promise you, it won't happen again.

### Mr Lime
Good, good. You're new here, aren't you Anna?

### Anna
Yes.

### Mr Lime
Well I look forward to working with you.
