### Narrator
Hello! Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading, where Anna's interview for a sales job continues. When we last said goodbye, Tip Top boss Paul had asked Anna why she wanted the job. First she said:
> 补充：bid farewell to 告别；诀别

### Anna
Errr... mmmmm...

### Narrator
Since then, she's added:

### Anna
Mmmm... errr...

### Narrator
And as we join her again, Anna is saying:

### Anna
Well, errrr... I'm errr.

### Narrator
Come on, Anna! If you can't think of the word you need, find another way of saying it.

### Anna
I am... Well, I really, really want this job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.

### Paul
So you’re very motivated, then?

### Anna
Motivated! Yes, that’s it. I am really motivated.

### Paul
Good! Why?

### Narrator
Now over to you Anna; structure your answer! Say, 'firstly', then give your first reason, 'secondly' and then a second reason. Then say, 'above all' and give a really, really good, enthusiastic final reason! Go for it: firstly! 
> 补充：文中的firstly..secondly..above all属于比较初级的用法，更正式的用法：firstly可以替换成to begin with, first of all; secondly可以替换成in addition, further more, moreover; above all的话可以用first but not least

> go for it 加油

### Anna
Firstly!

### Paul
Firstly...?

### Anna
Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience: I've spent several years working in sales and I get on with people easily. Well, I mean, apart from the ones I don't like, of course. Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies in London, and I want to be part of that.
> get on with sb 和...友好相处

> apart from 除了

### Paul
That's absolutely right. Tip Top Trading is the fastest-growing company in the plastic fruit sector. But enough about the company; this is all about you, Annabel.
> But enough about company 不说公司了

### Anna
Anna.

### Paul
Sorry, Anna. Where were we?
> 我们说到哪了（需要结合语境）

### Anna
Well, I said that firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience, secondly, the company is growing fast... and… and… above all… the reason I want this job is…

### Paul
Yes? (knock on the door) Denise! Is everything alright?

### Denise
No Paul, it’s not. Everything is not OK!

### Paul
You look pale. Here, sit down, drink what's left of my tea.
> pale adj.（脸色）苍白的

### Denise
Oh, thank you! Oh… what are those bits floating in it?

### Paul
Oh they're just lumps of soggy biscuit. In fact, if I can just... get that bit out... with my finger... for you… Mmm, delicious! Now, tell me what happened.
> lumps 块

> soggy adj. 湿而软的; 潮湿的

### Denise
Well, it's terrible...

### Narrator
Oh dear! Just as Anna was doing really well, it looks like her interview has come to a sudden end. What’s happened? Join us next time to find out. But before we go, here's a reminder of how Anna structured her response:
> come to a end 结束 eg.
> We had come to a dead end in our research
> 我们的研究工作已陷入绝境。

Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience

Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies in London and…

above all… the reason I want this job is…

Anna couldn’t remember the word ‘motivated’, so she just found another way of saying what she meant.

I really, really want the job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.

Nice work, Anna! Let's hope you get the chance to finish your interview next week!
