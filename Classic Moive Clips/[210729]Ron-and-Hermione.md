Ron: Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.

Harry: No, not at all.

Ron: I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.

Harry: I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

Ron: So-so it's true? I mean, do you really have the...the...

Harry: The what?

Ron: `Scar`...?

Harry: Oh

Ron: `Wicked`.

Woman: Anything `off the trolley`, dears?

Ron: [Holds up his mushed sandwiches] No, thanks, `I'm all set`. 

Harry: We'll `take the lot`! 

Ron: Whoa!

Harry: Bertie Bott's Every `Flavour` Beans?

Ron: They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and `peppermint`, and there's also `spinach`, `liver` and `tripe`. George sweared he got a `bogey-flavoured` one once!

Harry: These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?

Ron: It's just a `spell`. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 `meself`. Watch it! Oh, that's `rotten luck`. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.

Harry: I got Dumbledore!

Ron: I got about 6 of him.

Harry: Hey, he's gone!

Ron: Well, you can't expect him to `hang around` all day, can you? This is Scabbers, by the way, `pathetic`, isn't he?

Harry: A little.

Ron: Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?

Harry: Yeah!

Ron: Ahem. Sun-

Hermione: Has anyone seen a `toad`? A boy named Neville's lost one.

Ron: No.

Hermione: Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.

Ron: Sunshine, daises, butter `mellow`, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!

Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example... Oculus Reparo. That's better, isn't it? `Holy Cricket`, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?

Ron: I'm...Ron Weasley. ..

Hermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your `robes`. I expect we'll be arriving soon. You've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there.
