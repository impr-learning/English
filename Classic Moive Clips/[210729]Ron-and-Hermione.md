Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example... Oculus Reparo. That's better, isn't it? `Holy Cricket`, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?

Ron: I'm...Ron Weasley. ..

Hermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your `robes`. I expect we'll be arriving soon. You've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there.
